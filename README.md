# Gravity Balls Simulation

This project is a simple simulation of balls obeying Earth-like gravity in a canvas. When clicked, it generates circles that move vertically, bounce upon hitting the bottom of the screen, and gradually slow down due to a damping effect.

## Features

- **Create Circles**: Click on the canvas to create circles at the clicked positions.
- **Realistic Gravity**: Circles move vertically obeying Earth-like gravity.
- **Bouncing Effect**: When circles hit the bottom of the screen, they bounce back.
- **Damping**: Circles gradually slow down after each bounce until they stop.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    https://github.com/serobXX/GravityBalls.git
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

3. Click on the canvas to create circles and see them interact with gravity.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- JavaScript
- Canvas API
